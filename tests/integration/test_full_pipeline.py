    _MOCK_PROSE = """
The most effective leaders share one counterintuitive trait: they listen more than they speak.
In study after study, teams led by quiet, attentive managers outperform those run by charismatic talkers.
Why? Because listening creates the psychological safety that unlocks honest feedback.
When your team knows you hear them, they bring you problems before they become crises.
Start this week by holding a thirty-minute one-on-one with no agenda except to ask questions.

Consider Sarah, a regional director who inherited a team with forty percent turnover.
She spent her first month doing nothing but listening to frontline staff, customers, and data nobody had read.
By month three, she had a clear picture of three fixable problems her predecessor had missed entirely.
Her team's turnover dropped to eight percent within a year, not because she was smarter, but because she paid attention.

The technique is simple but requires discipline. Block your calendar for focused listening sessions.
Turn off notifications. Ask open-ended questions and resist the urge to jump in with solutions.
Your job in these sessions is to understand, not to fix.
The fixing comes later, and it will be far more accurate because of what you learned.

Most organizations have feedback mechanisms that look good on paper but fail in practice.
Annual performance reviews arrive too late to change anything meaningful.
Suggestion boxes collect dust. Town halls become one-way broadcasts.
The problem is not the format but the frequency and the follow-through.
People stop sharing when they see their input disappear without acknowledgment.

Listening at scale requires systems, not just intentions. Build a weekly cadence of brief check-ins.
Use structured questions so you gather comparable data over time.
Ask the same three questions every week: What is working? What is blocked? What do you need from me?
The consistency matters as much as the questions themselves.
